   <p style="color: cyan"> I miss you alot Ken I really do, but I just can't have the courage to talk to you.
     But I'll tell you mostly everything that I want to say to youu right here, I might use alot of languages so ikaw
     na bahala mag translate HAHAHAHA  </p>
  
   <p style="color: cyan"> grabi nani akong kabuang nga gipang buhat do HAHAHAHAðŸ˜­ anyway uy kasamoy ba here we go</p>
   
   
   <p style="color: cyan""> Hello, Gwyn! It has been a few months na noh? HAHAHAHA I just want to say sorry for all the things nga
     nga akong nabuhat, for all the wrong decisions that I have made, I am sorry that I suddenly left without any explanation, I just thought
     that maybe you needed some space, and you were so busy sa acads that time, so I thought maybe I'll let things be muna </p>
   
   
   <p style="color: cyan""> But you know, ever since the day that I did that, I wasn't being myself na kumbaga feel nako nga naay kulang sa akoa
     I feel like there's a hole in my heart, but I can't do anything about it, I already left youu and then mo balik ra lugar ko nga murag way nahitabo?
     So I said to myself that maybe I should just let things be, and just go with the flow, and I have made the wrong decision because I thought maybe
     -maybe I'll move on some dayy, but I did not. I tried to do everything just to move on but I didn't, or maybe I didn't really try? My mind would be rambling
      everyday thinking why I did that shit. I just realized na hindi ko pala kaya, hindi ko kayang mawalay sa'yo mahal ko, no matter how hard I would try to avoid you 
      kahit ilang daan na ang aking tinahak papalayo sa'yo, ang mga daang iyon rin pala ang tuturo sa'kin patungo sa'yo Ken. </p>

   <p style="color: cyan""> Ever since that day, you have never left my mind, I would go through your socmeds and stalk you almost everyday just to at least know
     how you are, and then when I see a picture of you with your friend, and seeing your gorgeous smile, those eyes that are just so beautiful. And then suddenly
     I would just start to miss you more and moree, and then there was one time na hindi ako nakapag pigil, that day on February 9th, oh how badly I wanted 
     to see you that midnight, I even did something so embarrassing wthðŸ˜­, and I'm so grateful for that Ken, thankyouu sa pag gawas and letting me see you that
     time, I really missed youu.</p>

   a chance to love you again? will you give me a chance to be better than I was before? will you give me a chance to be yours once again, Ken? Will you give me a chance to try again?   </p>
